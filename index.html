            Paragliding is an extreme air sport in which a pilot controls a lightweight, fabric canopy, known as a "wing," to achieve sustained flight. It has no rigid frame and is designed to be aerodynamic, creating lift as it catches wind. Suspension lines connect the wing to the pilot via a harness.

            Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break and lose their energy.
            In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore.
            
            There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves.
            
            The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard.
            
            Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.
            
            Many surf historians and enthusiasts believe that the essence of surfing is in bodysurfing, the art of gliding over the waves using only the body as a planing surface.
            
            According to the University of Hawaii, bodysurfing dates back as far as 2,000 BC, but the first evidence of bodysurfing activity in the Western world only emerged in 1899, when Australian Fred Williams got a few lessons from Polynesian islander Tommy Tana.
            
            The origins of the pastime can be traced back to the ancient Polynesian culture, specifically in the islands of Hawaii, wh

            Bikers get their share of wisdom while they embark on a journey with their sweethearts AND by that I mean their beloved bikes. Bike ride duration is the time to unleash the explorer in them and mend roads to self discovery. For such passionate bike riders, India seems to be the perfect match as it can offer such experience that practically has no match. Whether it is the highest snow-clad peaks of the Himalaya, the dense forests of North East or the most deserted places of Rajasthan; motorbike tours in India not only provide easy access to remote places but also helps in understanding the countryâ€™s diversity better.
